# Student Directory #

    The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled at Villains Academy. During the Pre-course at Makers Academy, I created a Student Directory command line app from scratch that would allow inputting, displaying, saving and loading of students of the directory. 

## How to use ##

```shell
ruby directory.rb
```
